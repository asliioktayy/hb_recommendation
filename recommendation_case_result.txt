PROJECT result


In this project, I developed a recommendation system for an online grocery store.
When a customer is landed on the cart page, I provided a
recommended product list which is related to the items in the cart.

events.json : add2cart events for a period of time
meta.json : meta info of products in the events

data dictionary 
event : whether the product added to basket or not (it can be "cart", "view", "purchase" etc. 
        But in this data, only added to cart. Also column includes one unique variable.
         Therefore it is not important)
sessionid : Every user have many sessionid but sessionid is belong to one user. There is one to many relation. 
            In the same session, it can be added many products.
eventtime: time for product added to basket. 
brand : product brand
category : product category
subcategory : product subcategory
name : product name. product name column is critical for recommendation when that column used by name similarity
price : product price

Firstly, I also analyzed data in exp_data_analysis.ipynb file at data analysis-visualization folder. I explored 
data, missing data, product distribution for month, category count based on many situation, 
Word distribution(frequent words)

There are many text column in data. I researched to do recommendation using name and other text column. 
Next step, I searched best practice for recommendation system with related products. I researched 
hepsiburada and other e-commerce sites for how recommend related products in these sites

Finally, I decided to use TfidfVectorizer and cosine similarity. I evaluated name similarity between products.
I applied different preprocesing methods like get new feature(price category) to improve my result.
Also, I applied text preprocesing techniques. Like get new feature(price category). 

Other method I used is doc2vec. I used same techniques for preprocessing. But similarity rate is worse
than other method.

I also started to apply association rules method, but it is not finished. Even so I added the codes for 
this methods.You can see at association_rules.py. If I had more time, I would have been finished this method too.

WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE, IF I HAD MORE TIME?
If I had more time, I want to researh another method like word2vec method, content and collaborative hybrid methods
When I researched the best practice, I have not faced an example where the time column is used. BNevertheless, I
think that event time can be useful column. Due to for example, watermelon was purchased in summer more than autumn 
or event hour can be affect if it is used in recommendation. If I had time, I would have tried to work for 
entegration time column to model.
